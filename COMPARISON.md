## Notes

**¹ roomba_rest980 map approach** uses the rest980 Node.js container as a middle layer: coordinates arrive via MQTT locally, rest980 logs them, and the integration fetches the rendered map image over HTTP. This works well when `pose` data is available but requires the container to run 24/7. Since iRobot firmware 3.20+, `pose` is no longer reported locally — the map feature is broken on all updated robots. A jailbreak approach (SSH + internal MQTT broker access) is in active development by the author but not yet publicly released.

**² Roomba+ map approach** renders entirely in-process using the same local MQTT `pose` stream, with no external container. It also stopped working on firmware 3.20+ for the same reason. For robots on older firmware both approaches are comparable in accuracy; Roomba+ has the advantage of surviving HA restarts via `hass.storage`.

**³ roomba_rest980 controls** (cleaning passes, edge cleaning, always finish, carpet boost) are available via the rest980 REST API but have no corresponding HA entity — they cannot be used in the HA Automation editor without custom scripts.

**⁴ iRobot / Picea Robotics cloud** — iRobot was acquired by Picea Robotics in January 2026. The Gigya authentication stack used by roomba_rest980's cloud features has been unstable since October 2024. Roomba+'s cloud features use the iRobot AWS endpoint directly, which has been stable throughout.

**⁵ ★ = best or most native implementation** for that feature across the three integrations. Multiple entries can share ★ where equally capable.
